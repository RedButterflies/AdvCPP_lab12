Tasks to perform:

Task 12.1. Algorithms
Write a program in which you create a vector container and fill it with numbers. Then enable the execution of the following algorithms on it:

Display all elements in such a way that each element is separated by the | character;
Calculate the arithmetic mean of the elements in the container;
Count how many even elements are in the container;
Remove elements that are negative;
Sort the elements in the container so that even elements come first, followed by odd elements;
Modify the value of each element by overwriting it with its negative;
Count how many elements are smaller than the received argument.
When implementing individual functionalities, use algorithms from the algorithm library, and create a lambda function as a comparator. In the main function, test the algorithms.

Task 12.2. Cars
Create a class Car that will represent a car and include:

Private fields for storing the car model, year of production, and engine capacity;
A constructor initializing all fields in the class;
Getters and setters for the fields;
A method displaying information about the car.
In the main function, create a container that will store objects of the Car class. Additionally, display the cars:

Sorted in ascending order by the year of production;
Sorted in descending order by engine capacity.
When displaying information about the car, a counter indicating which car it is (1, 2, 3, etc.) should be displayed before the information about that car.

Task 12.3. Statistics
Write a function that receives a container storing strings (string type) as an argument. The function should return the following values:

The length of the shortest string;
The average length of a string;
The longest string.
Use lambda functions and available algorithms to find the values mentioned above. The values should be returned as a tuple. In the main function, display the values returned by the function.
